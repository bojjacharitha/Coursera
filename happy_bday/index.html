                <h2>Archimedes</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded the sciences of mechanics and hydrostatics, calculated pi precisely, devised the law of exponents, created new geometrical proofs, invented numerous ingenious mechanical devices and more.

                <p>
                    Discovered the Bernoulli Effect explaining how aircraft wings generate lift; formulated a kinetic theory relating the phenomenon of temperature to particle speeds in gases; made major discoveries in the theory of risk.

                <p>
                    Founded quantum mechanics when he remodeled the atom so electrons occupied ‘allowed’ orbits around the nucleus while all other orbits were forbidden; architect of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
